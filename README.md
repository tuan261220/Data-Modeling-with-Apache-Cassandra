# Data-Modeling-with-Apache-Cassandra

This is second project submission for DE Nanodegree

This project follows some of the concepts like:
- Data modeling with Apache Cassandra
- ETL pipeline using Python

## Project Summary

The goal of this project is create a NoSQL analytics database in Apache Cassandra for app music history.

As the data engineer assigned to the project, I have implemented an ETL pipeline in python to pre-process the data using pandas. The database tables are modeled on the queries according to the principle of one table per query. I selected the primary and clustering keys for each table in order to ensure a unique identifier for each row

## Project structure
1. **DataModelingwithApacheCassandra.ipynb** the code itself.
2. **README.md** current file, provides discussion on my project.

## How to Run

Run **DataModelingwithApacheCassandra.ipynb** to create table and validation the query
